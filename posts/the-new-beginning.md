# So, the new beginning?

So I had a blog once, it died. Well... actually it died twice, but nevermind. This is my next fight with laziness, regularity and myself. 
Why I'm trying to do so? Well, I think that I have few things which are worth sharing, and I really like talking about stuff. 

Also I want to participate in [Get Noticed!](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac/) competition, and therefore I'll be 
describing my work on [Nucleus](https://github.com/kadet1090/nucleus). For first weeks I want to describe some things
that I have already wrote so expect some informations about React, Events, Properties, why DOM Sucks so much, and few other.
And when my source of topics from the past will drain I'll be describing actual progress. Also in meantime i want to publish
smth about my other child - [Keylighter](https://github.com/kadet1090/keylighter) - mainly because it's more focused on
performance than Nucleus and i'll be able to describe some hacks.

And that's probably all about content, now about technical things. This blog will look different but I don't really have
time to make it pretty now - so this is task for future myself.
